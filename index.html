	<h3> For always voters, it seems pretty evenly split between education levels, 
		with maybe slightly more of them having college education; they also 
		look evenly split between income levels. Sporadic voters also look 
		evenly split amongst again with slightly more being college educated; 
		income levels look evenly split. Finally, the rarely voters also look 
		evenly split by education with slightly more having high school or less 
		education; they also tend to have lower income levels with a clear 
		majority having $75K or less.  </h3>
	<h3> Higher income levels tend to correlate with higher education levels. \
		For example, almost no one making less the $40K a year has a college
		education, and the vast majority of earners making $125K a year or 
		more have a college education.  </h3>
