	For always voters, it seems pretty evenly split between education levels,
	with maybe slightly more of them having college education; they also 
	look evenly split between income levels. Sporadic voters also look 
	evenly split amongst again with slightly more being college educated; 
	income levels look evenly split. Finally, the rarely voters also look 
	evenly split by education with slightly more having high school or less 
	education; they also tend to have lower income levels with a clear 
	majority having $75K or less. 
	Higher income levels tend to correlate with higher education levels. 
	For example, almost no one making less the $40K a year has a college 
	education, and the vast majority of earners making $125K a year or 
	more have a college education.

	2020 has a much higher percentage of absentee ballots. If I had to 
	guess this would be because of the pandemic. The differences between
	congressional election years (2016 and 2020) compared to others are
	slightly noticable, but the outliers that somehow have more than 100% 
	voter turnout in 2018 make it difficult to see. 2016 and 2020 cluster
	around about 75% voter turnout, while 2014 and 2022 are closer to 
	50%. 2018 also seems to have higher voter turnout more in line with 
	2016 and 2020.
