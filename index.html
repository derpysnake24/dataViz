	For always voters, it seems pretty evenly split between education levels,
	with maybe slightly more of them having college education; they also 
	look evenly split between income levels. Sporadic voters also look 
	evenly split amongst again with slightly more being college educated; 
	income levels look evenly split. Finally, the rarely voters also look 
	evenly split by education with slightly more having high school or less 
	education; they also tend to have lower income levels with a clear 
	majority having $75K or less. 
	Higher income levels tend to correlate with higher education levels. 
	For example, almost no one making less the $40K a year has a college 
	education, and the vast majority of earners making $125K a year or 
	more have a college education.

	2020 has a much higher percentage of absentee ballots. If I had to <br>
	guess this would be because of the pandemic. The differences between<br>
	congressional election years (2016 and 2020) compared to others are <br>
	slightly noticable, but the outliers that somehow have more than 100% <br>
	voter turnout in 2018 make it difficult to see. 2016 and 2020 cluster <br>
	around about 75% voter turnout, while 2014 and 2022 are closer to <br>
	50%. 2018 also seems to have higher voter turnout more in line with <br>
	2016 and 2020.
